# ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ Connect4 with Minimax and Q-Learning

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements the classic **Connect4** game in Python, featuring a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for a more interactive playing experience. It includes two intelligent game-playing approaches:
1. **Minimax Algorithm**: Used for strategic decision-making, ensuring optimal moves for the current player.
2. **Q-Learning Agent**: A reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Connect4 through experience, improving its strategy over time.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŽ® **Play Connect4** in a user-friendly GUI.
- ðŸ§  **Minimax Algorithm**: A recursive, depth-limited tree search for optimal moves.
- ðŸ¤– **Q-Learning Agent**: Learns the game from scratch through exploration and exploitation, improving over multiple games.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Adjustable difficulty** by setting the depth of the Minimax tree or the exploration rate of the Q-learning agent.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms
### 1. **Minimax Algorithm**
- A decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. This algorithm is depth-limited and evaluates possible moves to maximize a player's chances of winning while minimizing the opponentâ€™s.

### 2. **Q-Learning**
- A reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the agent to learn through experience. The agent updates its knowledge after every game by adjusting the Q-values based on rewards for each state-action pair, eventually learning an optimal strategy.

4. Play the game in the GUI and choose to compete against:
   - The **Minimax AI**.
   - The **Q-learning agent** that learns over time.


## ðŸŽ“ How Q-Learning Works in This Project
- The agent starts without any knowledge of the game.
- Through playing games, it learns by trial and error using a reward-based system.
- The Q-values are updated after each game to reflect better strategies.
